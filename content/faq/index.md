**Q: Is there a dress code?**

**A:** We invite you to celebrate with us in black tie attire, though it is not mandatory. Feel free to dress in your finest evening wear.

**Q: Is there a wedding registry?**


**A:** Thank you for thinking of us! We have chosen not to have a wedding registry. Your presence at our celebration is a wonderful gift in itself.

**Q: What is the parking situation?**

There is plenty of free parking at both the church and the reception venue.

**Q: Will there be transportation to/from events?**

As there is no central place at which the majority of guests are staying and to which we could send a shuttle, we are instead providing a Lyft voucher to help cover costs to/from the festivities.

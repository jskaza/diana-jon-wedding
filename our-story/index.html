<p>Jon and Diana first met in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the late summer of 2016. Jon was about to begin his second year of graduate school at the University of Michigan, while Diana was an incoming student, about to begin her first. Growing up in Boston and living there her whole life up until moving to Michigan, Diana's first memory of Jon was seeing him walk into an orientation event wearing a Red Sox shirt. A bit homesick, Diana was excited about the prospect of a Boston connection but, unfortunately, Jon seemed to be in a rush. Jon's first memory of Diana was also during an orientation event. As fate would have it, Jon's friend was assigned as Diana's &quot;mentor&quot;, alerting Jon to the Boston connection.</p>
<p>Jon and Diana slowly became friends during their time in Michigan. Jon decided to stick around Ann Arbor working as a post-graduate researcher while Diana was still a student. As they lived within walking distance of each other, Jon would often hang out and help with courses that he had already taken and the two would go on runs, to the gym, and for late night snacks. Yet, there was still no &quot;dating&quot;.</p>
<p>Come spring 2018, Diana had graduated, moved back to Boston, and was job hunting. Jon had wrapped up his research endeavors and was also on the search for a new challenge. Jon ultimately received a job offer back in Boston, knew that Diana was still searching, and referred her to the same company. The two would then become coworkers, and remain close friends, from 2018-2021. </p>
<p>Fast forward to 2021. Diana was ready to make a career change and accepted a new job offer. She knew that the first person she had to tell was Jon, and did so one night in September 2021. Jon was gutted to have Diana, a constant source of joy in his day-to-day, removed just like that. After a week of reflection, during which Diana was annoyed at the lack of responsiveness to her texts, Jon knew what he had to do: ask out Diana, the threat of separation awakened his love. A few days after, Jon and Diana had a discussion that led to the start of their romantic relationship. A year and a half later, Jon proposed to Diana in Vermont, amongst the beautiful landscape featured above.</p>
<p>In their minds, the deep love present in their relationship is a product of several years of friendship prior to dating. A history of friendship made the first few dates easy, there was no need for common &quot;first date&quot; question such as &quot;what do you do for work?&quot; and &quot;where are you originally from?&quot;, as each already knew a good bit about the other. Instead, there was an immediate desire to discuss—and ultimately build—a future with each other.</p>
